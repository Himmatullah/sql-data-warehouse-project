# sql-data-warehouse-project
A complete SQL Data Warehouse project demonstrating ETL processes, dimensional modeling, fact and dimension tables, OLAP operations, and reporting for analytical insights.

# SQL Data Warehouse Project

## Specification
This project demonstrates a complete SQL Data Warehouse implementation, including:
- ETL process (Extract, Transform, Load)
- Staging and integration layers
- Dimension and Fact tables
- Star and Snowflake schema designs
- OLAP operations: Slice, Dice, Drill-down, Roll-up
- Indexes and aggregates for performance optimization
- Example analytical queries for reporting and decision-making

## Data Source
- Multiple source systems such as SQL Server databases, CSV files, and Excel sheets
- Historical transactional data extracted for analysis
- Cleaned, standardized, and validated before loading into the warehouse

## Data Quality
- Ensures accuracy, consistency, and completeness of data
- Handles duplicates, missing values, and inconsistent formats
- Validates data against business rules before integration

## Integration
- Data from different sources is combined in the integration layer
- Transformation rules applied to standardize data
- Loaded into dimension and fact tables for analytical queries

## Scope
- Support business intelligence and reporting needs
- Enable historical data analysis and trend identification
- Useful for learning ETL processes, dimensional modeling, and OLAP operations

## Documentation
- Detailed schema diagrams (star and snowflake)
- Sample ETL scripts and SQL queries
- Step-by-step workflow from staging to analytical reporting

## BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analytics)
- Designed to support business intelligence (BI) operations
- Provides analytical insights for decision-making
- Example dashboards and reports can be generated using SQL queries or BI tools like Power BI / Tableau

## Objective
The objective of this project is to:
- Understand the complete workflow of a Data Warehouse
- Build hands-on experience with ETL, dimensional modeling, and OLAP operations
- Enable analysis and reporting on historical data efficiently
